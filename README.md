# cli-mate

Go is a fantastic language to build CLI tooling, specially the ones for interacting with an API server. `<your tool>ctl` anyone?

But if you're tired of building bespoke CLIs everytime or think that the swagger codegen isn't just good enough, look no further.

What if you can influence the client side behaviour from the server side?

## Docs coming soon, work in progress.
